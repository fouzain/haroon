            The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and
            sold. Such financial activities are conducted through formal exchanges and via over-the-counter (OTC)
            marketplaces that operate under a defined set of regulations. <br> <br>

            Both “stock market” and “stock exchange” are often used interchangeably. Traders in the stock market buy or
            sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that are part of the overall stock market.

            Stock markets provide a secure and regulated environment where market participants can transact in shares
            and
            other eligible financial instruments with confidence, with zero to low operational risk. Operating under the
            defined rules as stated by the regulator, the stock markets act as primary markets and secondary markets.
            <br> <br>

            As a primary market, the stock market allows companies to issue and sell their shares to the public for the
            first time through the process of an initial public offering (IPO). This activity helps companies raise
            necessary capital from investors. <br> <br>

            A company divides itself into several shares and sells some of those shares to the public at a price per
            share. <br> <br>

            To facilitate this process, a company needs a marketplace where these shares can be sold and this is
            achieved by
            the stock market. A listed company may also offer new, additional shares through other offerings at a later
            stage, such as through rights issues or follow-on offerings. They may even buy back or delist their shares.
            <br> <br>

            Investors will own company shares in the expectation that share value will rise or that they will receive
            dividend payments or both. The stock exchange acts as a facilitator for this capital-raising process and
            receives a fee for its services from the company and its financial partners. <br> <br>

            Using the stock exchanges, investors can also buy and sell securities they already own in what is called the
            secondary market. <br> <br>

            The stock market or exchange maintains various market-level and sector-specific indicators, like the S&P
            (Standard & Poor’s) 500 index and the Nasdaq 100 index, which provide a measure to track the movement of the
            overall market.

            The stock market ensures price transparency, liquidity, price discovery, and fair dealings in trading
            activities. <br> <br>

            The stock market guarantees all interested market participants have access to data for all buy and sell
            orders, thereby helping in the fair and transparent pricing of securities. The market also ensures efficient
            matching of appropriate buy and sell orders. <br> <br>


            Stock markets need to support price discovery where the price of any stock is determined collectively by all
            of its buyers and sellers. Those qualified and willing to trade should get instant access to place orders
            and the market ensures that the orders are executed at a fair price. <br> <br>

            Traders on the stock market include market makers, investors, traders, speculators, and hedgers. An investor
            may buy stocks and hold them for the long term, while a trader may enter and exit a position within seconds.
            A market maker provides necessary liquidity in the market, while a hedger may trade in derivatives.
